# Initialize Generator

Documentation for creating an instance of the HMAC-Based One-Time Password Generator.

## Create Instance

You can create an instance of the HotpGenerator in the following way:

```kotlin
val hotpGenerator = HotpGenerator()
```

## Spring Boot

Instead of creating a new instance of a generator each time a token is checked, it is also possible to create a bean within Spring.
This allows to configure the generator once and this configuration is maintained each time the bean is injected into a component.

```kotlin
@Bean
fun hotpGenerator(): HotpGenerator {
    val generator = HotpGenerator()
    generator.codeLength = 6
    return generator
}
```

This bean can then be injected in the constructor of any class marked with @Component (@Service, ...).

```kotlin
@Component
class CustomComponent(private val hotpGenerator: HotpGenerator) {
	//...
}
```

## Customize properties

It is possible to customize the properties of the generator, either by setters or applying them in the constructor.

### Code length

The code length specifies how long a generated code will be. If the code length is changed, it is necessary that the user's authenticator app supports this as well.

:::danger Could break logic
Most authenticator apps, such as those from Microsoft or Google, use a length of 6 digits. If you change this number, they are no longer usable.
However, remember that that they are widely used before you drop support for them.
