# Initialize Generator

The random generator is internally used by the secret generator and recovery-code generator to create randomly generated secure strings.

## Create random generator

You can create an instance of the RandomGenerator in the following way:

```kotlin
val randomGenerator = RandomGenerator()
```

## Customize properties

It is possible to customize the properties of the generator, either by setters or applying them in the constructor.

#### Random (Dangerous)

The generator accepts any class implementing the java random interface.
:::danger
The default used random implementation is java's official secure random implementation and should not be changed unless you know what you are doing!
:::

#### Charpool (Dangerous)

The char pool specifies the list of characters that can be used to generate the string.
:::danger
If the char pool gets too small, the security is weakend. For example a 10-character long password with the default charset of the library has the following properties:

- Combinations: 62^{10} = 8.3929937e^{17}
- Entropy: log_2(62^{10}) = 59.542

Passwords with a entropy >50 are considered to be secure by many researchers (Greater is always better).
