# Generate Recovery-Codes

This generator can be used to create randomly generated strings in block form.

## generateRecoveryCode

### Info

You can create a recovery-code with the this method. Typically, recovery-codes are used to authenticate when a user loses access to their second factor device.

### Usage

```kotlin
recoveryCodeGenerator.generateRecoveryCode()
```

This will generate a recovery code similar to the following code:

```kotlin
> "AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD"
```

***

## generateRecoveryCodes

### Info

Usually a user receives multiple recovery-codes. You can use the following helper method to generate a list of
recovery-codes instead of calling the single method multiple times.

### Usage

```kotlin
recoveryCodeGenerator.generateRecoveryCodes(number = 3)
```

The generated list looks like this:

```kotlin
> ["AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD", "BBBB-AAAA-CCCC-DDDD", "BBBB-AAAA-DDDD-CCCC"]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Constraint |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ---------- |
| number   | Int  | 5       | >= 0       |
